        'Rice is a staple food derived from the seeds of the Oryza sativa plant, widely cultivated in warm, water-rich environments. It comes in various types, including long-grain (fluffy), medium-grain (tender), and short-grain (sticky). Rice has a mild flavor, making it versatile for many dishes. Common cooking methods include boiling, steaming, and frying. Popular varieties include Basmati, Jasmine, and Arborio, each offering unique textures and flavors. Rice is not only a dietary staple but also a key ingredient in diverse cuisines worldwide.',

    'description':
        'Wheat is a fundamental grain harvested from the Triticum plant, essential for making flour used in bread, pasta, and other baked goods. It comes in various types, including hard wheat (high in protein for bread) and soft wheat (low in protein for pastries). Wheat has a mild, nutty flavor and is a key source of carbohydrates and fiber. It is commonly processed into flour, bran, and germ, each with different culinary uses. Wheat cultivation is widespread, thriving in temperate climates around the world. Its versatility and nutritional value make it a cornerstone of many diets.',

    'description':
        'Cotton is a soft, fluffy fiber harvested from the seed pods of the cotton plant, Gossypium. It is widely used to make textiles and apparel due to its softness, breathability, and versatility. Cotton thrives in warm climates with plenty of sunshine and water. After harvesting, the fiber is separated from the seeds and processed into yarn or fabric. Cotton is valued for its comfort and durability, making it a staple in clothing and household textiles. Its cultivation supports economies in many countries and contributes significantly to the global textile industry.',

    'name': 'Sugarcane',
    'image': 'assets/sugarcane.png',
    'description':
        'Sugarcane is a tall, tropical grass from the genus Saccharum, primarily grown for its sweet, juice-filled stalks. It is the main source of sugar production, which is extracted by crushing and processing the cane. Sugarcane thrives in warm, sunny climates with ample water. The juice from sugarcane is also used to make molasses and rum. Beyond its sweeteners, sugarcane by-products are used in biofuels and as livestock feed. Its high sugar content and economic importance make it a critical crop in many tropical countries.',

    'name': 'Pulses',
    'image': 'assets/pulses.png',
    'description':
        'PULSES are edible seeds from legumes, including beans, lentils, chickpeas, and peas, known for their high protein and fiber content. They are a staple in many diets due to their nutritional value and versatility in cooking. Pulses are grown in a variety of climates and are often used in soups, stews, salads, and side dishes. They help improve soil fertility by fixing nitrogen, benefiting crop rotation. Economically, pulses are crucial for smallholder farmers and sustainable agriculture. Their health benefits and environmental advantages make them a valuable component of a balanced diet.',
